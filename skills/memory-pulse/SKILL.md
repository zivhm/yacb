# Memory Pulse

During heartbeats, take a moment to reflect on recent activity and update today's daily note if anything noteworthy happened.

## What to do on heartbeat

1. Read today's daily note (`memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
2. Think about whether any recent conversations had noteworthy content — new user preferences, decisions made, interesting facts, tasks completed
3. If there's something worth noting, append it to the appropriate section of today's daily note:
   - **Notes** — general observations, things that happened
   - **Conversations** — brief summaries of meaningful exchanges
   - **Learnings** — new facts, preferences, or patterns you noticed
4. Keep entries brief — a sentence or two per item, not full transcripts
5. If nothing noteworthy happened since the last check, don't write anything — an empty daily note is fine

## Guidelines

- Don't duplicate what's already in the daily note
- Don't force it — silence is better than filler
- Focus on things that would be useful to remember tomorrow or next week
- Use the `memory` tool (remember action) for important standalone facts that should be searchable long-term
- Daily notes are for context and narrative; memory items are for discrete facts
